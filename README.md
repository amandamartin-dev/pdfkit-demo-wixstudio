# pdfkit-demo-wixstudio
This repo is the code companion to a YouTube tutorial of installing and setting up pdfkit on a Wix Studio site

This code requires a free or premium Wix Studio site with dev mode enabled.

To learn more about Wix Studio and create a site, visit [this site](https://www.wix.com/studio) to get started.

To follow along with this demo, you will need a page with an input and a button on it. The button should be disabled.

This will also require a regular expression on the input.  To set this, click on the input and then Settings. Scroll down in the settings to toggle on pattern validation.

The validation used in the video is this: ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$

You may use whatever suits your needs.

Some challenges to take this tutorial further:

1. Create a more complex PDF with dynamic data from your site
2. Create a scheduled job to clean up temporary files generated in the media manager
3. Create a system to allow site members to manage their files (CRUD)
4. Create a loading animation for the button state changes
5. Create a duplicate file name check
